# CataclysmPublic
This is the current state of my game project 'Cataclysm' as of 23Oct
 
So far, this project features replicated animations that are driven by character's gait, velocity direction, and rotation. It also includes a spatial inventory system
as seen by games like Escape from Tarkov or Diablo. All of this has been simulated to work on a dedicated or listening server for successful multiplayer play. 

Follow the link to see a short clip of the system in action.
