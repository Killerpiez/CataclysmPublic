# CataclysmPublic
This is the current state of my game project 'Cataclysm' as of 23Oct

I separated my Catacylsm project into 2 repositories. 1 public and 1 private. The private repository contains licensed icons, UI, images, and other assets
that I have purchased but don't have rights to distribute. This repository contains the back and front end code that's involved in my project. 
So far, this project features replicated animations that are driven by character's gait, velocity direction, and rotation. It also includes a spatial inventory system
as seen by games like Escape from Tarkov or Diablo. All of this has been simulated to work on a dedicated or listening server for successful multiplayer play.
